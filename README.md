## Overview

In this repository, I explore key algorithms in machine learning and deep learning, implementing them from the ground up using Python and NumPy. Each implementation is designed to illustrate the underlying mechanics of the algorithm.

## Courses Followed

I am following the following courses by Andrew Ng to guide my implementations:

- [CS229: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)

These courses provide a solid theoretical foundation and practical insights into machine learning and deep learning.

## Algorithms Implemented

This repository includes implementations of algorithms such as:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Basic Perceptron
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Multi-Class Softmax Regression
- Support Vector Machine (Optimal Margin Classifier without Kernels)

Please refer to the respective folders or files for specific algorithm implementations and details.
